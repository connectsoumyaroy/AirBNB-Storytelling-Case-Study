## Analysis (steps)
### 1. Importing libraries and reading the data
### 2. Creating features
#### 2.1 categorizing the "availability_365" column into 5 categories
#### 2.2 categorizing the "minimum_nights" column into 5 categories
#### 2.3 categorizing the "number_of_reviews" column into 5 categories
#### 2.4 categorizing the "price" column into 5 categories
### 3. Fixing columns
### 4. Data types
#### 4.1 Categorical
#### 4.2 Numerical
#### 4.3 Coordinates and date
### 5. Missing values
#### 5.1 Missing values Analysis
#### 5.2 Missing values Analysis ('neighbourhood_group' feature)
#### 5.3 Missing values Analysis ('room_type' feature)
### 6. Univariate Analysis
#### 6.1 name
#### 6.2 host_id
#### 6.3 host_name
#### 6.4 neighbourhood_group

## Recommendations

- Shared rooms need to be inspected upon.
- The cumulative contribution of all hosts is better than a few hosts doing well.
- More than 80 % of the listing areManhattan and Brooklyn neighborhood group.
- Minimum nights threshold should be on the lower side to make propertiesmore customer-oriented.

## Conclusion
- Strong significant insights are derived based on various attributes in the dataset.
- Ample amount and variety of visuals have can used in the presentations for the stake-holders.
- Data collection team should collect data about review scores so that it can strengthen the later analysis.
- A clustering machine learning model to identify groups of similar objects in datasets with two or more variable quantities can be made.
